    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "An empty set, also called a null set, is a set that contains no elements. In probability theory, it represents an impossible event - an event that cannot occur in the given sample space. For example, when rolling a die, the event \"rolling a 7\" is an empty set because it cannot happen with a standard six-sided die.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notation\n",
    "∅ or { } or E = ∅ or P(∅) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "* ∅ - Symbol for empty set\n",
    "* { } - Alternative notation for empty set using empty curly braces\n",
    "* E = ∅ - Notation indicating event E is impossible\n",
    "* P(∅) = 0 - Probability of empty set is always zero\n",
    "* ∈ - When used with ∅, no element belongs to it (x ∉ ∅ for all x)"
