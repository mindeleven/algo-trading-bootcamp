#### Can you give me a list of exchanges where I can trade crypto and which offer and API interface?

I aim to help by providing information about cryptocurrency exchanges with API capabilities, but I should note that you should always conduct your own due diligence regarding any crypto trading platform. Here are some major exchanges that offer API interfaces:

1. Binance - Offers extensive REST and WebSocket APIs with comprehensive documentation. Known for high liquidity and wide variety of trading pairs.

2. Coinbase Pro - Has a robust API suitable for both simple and complex trading strategies. Features strong security measures and regulatory compliance.

3. Kraken - Provides both REST and WebSocket APIs. Well-regarded for security and offers advanced order types.

4. FTX - Note: While historically significant, FTX collapsed in late 2022. I mention this as a cautionary example of why due diligence is crucial.

5. KuCoin - Offers comprehensive API documentation and supports numerous trading pairs.

6. Gemini - Known for security and compliance, offers both REST and WebSocket APIs.

Key considerations when choosing an exchange API:
- Check if it's licensed to operate in your jurisdiction
- Review API rate limits and trading fees
- Examine security features and authentication methods
- Consider the available trading pairs
- Look into API documentation quality and community support

Would you like me to provide more specific details about any particular exchange's API features?

#### I would need an exchange that allows to operate in a test environment.

Here are some major exchanges that offer test environments (often called "testnet" or "sandbox"):

Good API documentation for the test environment

Would you like me to provide more specific information about Bitget's API documentation or the setup process for their test environment?

Note that while I aim to provide accurate information, you should verify these details directly from Bitget's official documentation, as exchange features and endpoints can change over time.
