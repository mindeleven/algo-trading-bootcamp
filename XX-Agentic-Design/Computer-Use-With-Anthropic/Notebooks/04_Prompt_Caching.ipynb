    "Prompt caching is a technique in large language model (LLM) applications where previously used prompts and their responses are stored and reused, rather than making a new LLM API call for identical or similar prompts. This reduces API costs, improves response times, and decreases computational load. When a new prompt comes in, the system first checks if a matching or similar prompt exists in the cache before sending the request to the LLM."
