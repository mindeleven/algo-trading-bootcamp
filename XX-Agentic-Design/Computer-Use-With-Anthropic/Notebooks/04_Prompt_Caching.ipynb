    "Prompt caching is a technique in large language model (LLM) applications where previously used prompts and their responses are stored and reused, rather than making a new LLM API call for identical or similar prompts. This reduces API costs, improves response times, and decreases computational load. When a new prompt comes in, the system first checks if a matching or similar prompt exists in the cache before sending the request to the LLM."

However, his departure is delayed when his adopted sister Elizabeth falls ill with scarlet fever.\\n\\n2. While caring for Elizabeth, Victor's mother catches the illness. On her deathbed, she expresses her wish for Victor and Elizabeth to marry, and then she dies.\\n\\n3. After his mother's death, Victor eventually departs for Ingolstadt, though he is reluctant to leave his grieving family.\\n\\n4. At the university, Victor meets two professors:\\n- Professor M. Krempe, who dismisses Victor's interest in alchemists like Cornelius Agrippa as outdated and worthless\\n- Professor M. Waldman, who takes a more sympathetic approach and encourages Victor to study modern chemistry and other branches of natural philosophy\\n\\n5. Waldman's influence proves crucial, as his lecture on modern science inspires Victor. The professor speaks about how modern scientists have achieved real power over nature, unlike the empty promises of the ancient alchemists.\\n\\n6. By the end of the chapter, Victor becomes completely devoted to his scientific studies at Ingolstadt, setting the stage for his future experiments in creating life.\\n\\nThis chapter marks an important turning point as Victor transitions from his sheltered home life to his university studies, and we see the beginning of his obsession with natural philosophy and the mysteries of life and death.\", type='text')]\n"
