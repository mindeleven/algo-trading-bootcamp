Customer support has been helpful in addressing some of my concerns, but they haven't been able to resolve the overheating issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while I'm impressed with certain aspects of the phone, the negatives are significant enough that I'm not sure I can wholeheartedly recommend it. It's a decent phone, but for the price, I expected fewer issues."
