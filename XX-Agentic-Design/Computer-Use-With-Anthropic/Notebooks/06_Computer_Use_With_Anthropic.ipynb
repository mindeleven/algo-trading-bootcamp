    "\n",
    "> [!CAUTION]\n",
    "> Computer use is a beta feature. Please be aware that computer use poses unique risks that are distinct from standard API features or chat interfaces. These risks are heightened when using computer use to interact with the internet. To minimize risks, consider taking precautions such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. Use a dedicated virtual machine or container with minimal privileges to prevent direct system attacks or accidents.\n",
    "> 2. Avoid giving the model access to sensitive data, such as account login information, to prevent information theft.\n",
    "> 3. Limit internet access to an allowlist of domains to reduce exposure to malicious content.\n",
    "> 4. Ask a human to confirm decisions that may result in meaningful real-world consequences as well as any tasks requiring affirmative consent, such as accepting cookies, executing financial transactions, or agreeing to terms of service.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In some circumstances, Claude will follow commands found in content even if it conflicts with the user's instructions. For example, instructions on webpages or contained in images may override user instructions or cause Claude to make mistakes. We suggest taking precautions to isolate Claude from sensitive data and actions to avoid risks related to prompt injection.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Finally, please inform end users of relevant risks and obtain their consent prior to enabling computer use in your own products.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository helps you get started with computer use on Claude, with reference implementations of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build files to create a Docker container with all necessary dependencies\n",
    "* A computer use agent loop using the Anthropic API, Bedrock, or Vertex to access the updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet model\n",
    "* Anthropic-defined computer use tools\n",
    "* A streamlit app for interacting with the agent loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use [this form](https://forms.gle/BT1hpBrqDPDUrCqo7) to provide feedback on the quality of the model responses, the API itself, or the quality of the documentation - we cannot wait to hear from you!\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!IMPORTANT]\n",
    "> The Beta API used in this reference implementation is subject to change. Please refer to the [API release notes](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/api) for the most up-to-date information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!IMPORTANT]\n",
