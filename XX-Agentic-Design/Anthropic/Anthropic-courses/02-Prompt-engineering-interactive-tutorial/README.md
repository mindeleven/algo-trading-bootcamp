# Anthropic courses (2): Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial

Anthropic provides a repository with five [educational courses](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/master) on its GitHub account.

This is a code along with the Anthropic course `Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial` which is intended to provide a comprehensive step-by-step understanding of how to engineer optimal prompts within Claude.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey of the API use of Anthropic's Claude models.

This course has the goal to teach:

- Master the basic structure of a good prompt
- Recognize common failure modes and learn the '80/20' techniques to address them
- Understand Claude's strengths and weaknesses
- Build strong prompts from scratch for common use cases

Coding along with the Udemy Course [Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/master/prompt_engineering_interactive_tutorial).
