# Anthropic courses (1): Anthropic API fundamentals

Anthropic provides a repository with five [educational courses](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/master) on its GitHub account.

This is a code along with the Anthropic course `Anthropic API fundamentals` which teaches the essentials of working with the Claude SDK: getting an API key, working with model parameters, writing multimodal prompts, streaming responses, etc.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey of the API use of Anthropic's Claude models.

In this course the essentials of working with Claude models and the Anthropic SDK are included:

- Getting an API key and making simple requests
- Working with the messages format
- Comparing capabilities and performance of the Claude model family
- Understanding model parameters
- Working with streaming responses
- Vision prompting
